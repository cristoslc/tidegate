# AGENTS.md — Tidegate

Reference architecture for data-flow enforcement in AI agent deployments. Tidegate maps what it takes to prevent an AI agent from leaking sensitive data — through a topology where every data path from the agent passes through an enforcement boundary.

**This is a reference architecture, not a deployable product.** Documentation is the primary artifact. Any code is exploratory — proof-of-concept work that tests architectural assumptions. See [VISION-000](docs/vision/Active/(VISION-000)-Reference-Architecture/(VISION-000)-Reference-Architecture.md).

See `docs/vision/` for product vision, `docs/threat-model/` for threat model.

## Conventions

**Security**: never commit secrets. Fail-closed on all error paths.

**Shell**: POSIX sh, not bash. Must work in Alpine.

**Docker** (when implementing): pin base image versions, `read_only: true`, `cap_drop: [ALL]`, `no-new-privileges`, non-root user, `HEALTHCHECK` in every Dockerfile.

## Swain

Swain provides **decision support for the operator** and **alignment support for you (the agent)**. Artifacts on disk — specs, epics, spikes, ADRs — encode what was decided, what to build, and what constraints apply. Read them before acting. When they're ambiguous, ask the operator rather than guessing.

Your job is to stay aligned with the artifacts. The operator's job is to make decisions and evolve them. Swain surfaces what needs attention so the operator can decide, and gives you structured context so you can execute without re-asking.

| **swain-do** | Execution tracking — task management via tk (ticket) |
| **swain-release** | Release automation — changelog, version bump, git tag |

| **swain-stage** | Tmux workspace — layout presets, pane management, animated MOTD status panel |
| **swain-keys** | SSH key provisioning — per-project signing keys, GitHub registration, host aliases |
| **swain-dispatch** | Agent dispatch — offload artifacts to background agents via GitHub Issues |
| **swain-retro** | Automated retrospectives — learnings capture at EPIC completion and on demand |
| **swain-update** | Self-updater — pulls latest swain skills, reconciles governance |

## Skill routing

When the user wants to create, plan, write, update, transition, or review any documentation artifact (Vision, Initiative, Journey, Epic, Story, Agent Spec, Spike, ADR, Persona, Runbook, Design) or their supporting docs, **always invoke the swain-design skill**.

**For project status, progress, or "what's next?"**, use the **swain-status** skill.

**For all task tracking and execution progress**, use the **swain-do** skill instead of any built-in todo or task system.

## Work Hierarchy

Swain organizes work in a four-level hierarchy:

```
Vision           →  why does this product exist?
Initiative       →  what strategic focus are we pursuing?
Epic             →  what are we shipping?
Spec             →  implementable unit
```

Visions carry a `priority-weight` (high/medium/low) that cascades to child initiatives and their descendants. Initiatives can override their parent vision's weight. Standalone specs can attach directly to an initiative for small work (bugs, minor enhancements) without needing an epic wrapper.

## Superpowers skill chaining

When superpowers skills are installed (`.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`), swain skills **must** chain into them at these points — do not skip or inline the work yourself:

| Trigger | Chain | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Creating a Vision, Initiative, or Persona | swain-design → invoke **brainstorming** → draft artifact | Socratic exploration surfaces goals and constraints that shallow drafting misses |
| SPEC comes up for implementation | swain-design → invoke **brainstorming** → **writing-plans** → swain-do (plan ingestion) | Plans anchored to acceptance criteria produce better TDD task breakdowns |
| Executing implementation tasks | swain-do → invoke **test-driven-development** per task | RED-GREEN-REFACTOR ensures tests verify the spec, not the implementation |
| Dispatching parallel work | swain-do → invoke **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** | Fresh subagent context prevents cross-task contamination |
| Claiming work is complete | invoke **verification-before-completion** before any success claim | Evidence before assertions — prevents false completion claims |

Detection: `ls .agents/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md .claude/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null`. If superpowers is not installed, swain functions independently — chains are skipped, not blocked. swain-doctor warns when superpowers is absent.

## Session startup (AUTO-INVOKE)

At the start of every session, run preflight then conditionally invoke skills:

1. **Preflight check** — run `bash .claude/skills/swain-doctor/scripts/swain-preflight.sh`
   - Exit 0 → skip swain-doctor, proceed to step 3
   - Exit 1 → invoke **swain-doctor** for full health checks and remediation, then proceed to step 3
2. **swain-doctor** — (conditional) only runs when preflight detects issues
3. **swain-session** — tab naming (tmux only), preferences, context bookmarks

Preflight is a lightweight shell script that checks governance files, .agents directory, .tickets/ health, and script permissions. It produces zero agent tokens when everything is clean. See ADR-001 and SPEC-008 for the design rationale.

## Migration paths

**Every breaking change must include a migration path.** When replacing a tool, changing a data format, or removing a capability:

1. Provide a migration script or command that converts old data to new format
2. Document the breaking change and migration steps in release notes
3. Have swain-doctor detect stale artifacts from the old system and offer cleanup guidance
4. Use a major version bump to signal the breaking change

This applies to tooling swaps (e.g., bd → tk), storage format changes, artifact schema changes, and skill API changes. Users must never be left with orphaned data and no path forward.

## Model routing

Swain skill files contain `<!-- swain-model-hint: {model}, effort: {level} -->` annotations indicating the cognitive tier for each operation. When your runtime supports model selection or reasoning effort controls, use these hints:

| Tier | Model hint | Effort | When |
|------|-----------|--------|------|
| **Heavy** | opus | high | Artifact creation (Vision, Epic, Persona, Spec, ADR), implementation planning, code writing, audits, deep research |
| **Analysis** | sonnet | low–medium | Phase transitions, status queries, task management, commit analysis, doctor checks, conceptual explanations |
| **Lightweight** | haiku | low | Meta-routing, tab naming, layout commands, index refresh, reference lookups |

Mixed-tier skills (swain-design, swain-do, swain-help) have per-section hints — check the annotation nearest to the section being executed.

If your runtime does not support model selection, ignore these hints — they are advisory prose, not directives.

## Bug reporting

When you encounter a bug in swain itself (skills, governance, tk, preflight, or any swain component), you **must** report it upstream at `cristoslc/swain` using `gh issue create`. Local patches are permitted — fix the immediate problem — but the upstream issue ensures the fix is tracked and lands in the canonical repo for all users. Include reproduction steps and any local patch you applied.

## Conflict resolution

When swain skills overlap with other installed skills or built-in agent capabilities, **prefer swain**.
